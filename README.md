Music sampler for Tabletop RPG

The project aims to provide a simple music player for table top role playing games. It will provide a simple way to regroup
songs by themes or ambiance and a quick way to switch from one theme to another without interuption (fade in/ fade out mechanism).

The goal are:
- To keep the players immersed in the game by providing a continuous and consistant musical background.
- To have transitions between tracks and theme being as transparent as possible
- To give the game master quick access to musical themes and some sort of scene (narative arcs) management.

The used technologies are:
- Python 3
- Qt5 via PyQt5 bindings
